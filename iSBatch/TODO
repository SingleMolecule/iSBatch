To do:


Table/Database Editor
Create database


Time lapse needs cells with lineage
Rapid acquisition does not


Add SQL queries
simple field, in case the user knows what he is doing. Table structure will be provided in the wiki




Sequence os possible experiments to analyse

1 - Import Files
2 - FlatFiles and assign cell outlines
	Show in the figure how the profile changes for one example in the BF and one in the fluorecence.
	Point out thatcell outlines are still an service provide from outside
	Show overlap of cells with images and also provide intensities graphs along the axis to reinforce that the images are flat
	
3 - For Time Lapse Database
	SHow cell intensity over time
	Number of foci/cell in each field - cells have to be linked in a lineage fashion
	Diffused fluorescence - estimation of cellular concentration
	

4 - For Rapid Acquisition

	Histogram of intensityes =- show when to cut 
	Single molecule decay trace
	Diffusion coefficient/show in the cell how the molecule is moving
		
	
5 - Example of custom macro
	The user shows one image and make ZStacks of different bins, like a 500 frame movie is used to make a series of2x2
	3x3 ... and so on.
	
	Them, peaks are counted and a plot N peaks X bin is plotted.
	Show the best framerate acquisition
