# Welcome to 	iSBatch

    iSBatch is a Java-based plugin for ImageJ (version 1.49d) or 
    its distribution Fiji. iSBatch is designed for quick evaluation
    of analysis pipelines and visual exploration of datasets. It is 
    distributed under an open open-source license
    (GNU General Public License, version 3). The plugin handles the data
    in a hierarchical fashion based on a source folder
    containing all data and little guidance provided by the user. 
    The software is designed for rapid exploration of large datasets
    and it includes an internal SQLite database (http://sqljet.com/) for convenience.
